# Higher-Lower-Fiask-
A simple Flask web app where users guess a number between 0 and 9 via the URL. The app responds with visual feedback using GIFs, indicating if the guess is too high, too low, or correct. A random number is generated at server start and remains fixed until restart. Fun way to learn Flask routing!
